# TBRPG
TBRPG is a game that me and my group partner Ashwin Kamalakannan. This project is game created with the Java Programming Language.
It uses knowledge of methods, arrays, and mathematical operations to develop the games core of finding monsters and beating them.
To make the game more compelling we added a full-fledged story, with unique classes that evolve as they progress through the game.
The game itself is played strictly inside the console/cmd, much like the old-school text-based role playing games, which is where
the name TBRPG was derived from.
